	<p> Hi, my name is Danny and I am a 26 year old total noob at coding. I have lived in London,UK and Heidelberg,DE and travelled extensively throughout western europe. I love being a student, travel, video games, reading thrillers and netflix binging too much for my own good.</p>
	<p> Coding is kind of horrifying but really cool at the same time. I guess I am equal parts terrified and exhilirated by code which in my mind is a pretty good place to be at. Furthermore, this stuff is interesting when I am trying to sleep at night or wasting time on youtube it is code I am thinking about how to refine or improve... so yay!</p>
