Second Class Repository
This was the main assignment for our cohorts second class and the aim was simple. Using vanilla html we made a simple site with less than 20 lines of code and input a <p> tag with a small amount of text. Rudimentary understanding was the main aim of this class. This was the origin of our coding journey.
